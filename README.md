# Waste Segmentation and detection AIDL project

This repository contains the code developed by Martí Fabregat, Rafel Febrer, Ferran Miró-Gea and Miguel Ortiz in the scope of AIDL postgraduate course in UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya). With supervision of Amanda Duarte.

A vision transformer (ViT) is trained and evaluated to segment and classify waste. The model has been trained using [TACO Dataset](http://tacodataset.org) by Pedro F Proença and Pedro Simões. For more details check the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06975
